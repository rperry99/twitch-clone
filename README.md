# Twitch Clone

**I first wan to say that I am doing this project purely for practicing CSS. All of the designs and icons are owned by Twtich, and I am only doing this project for CSS Practice. I do not intend to sell or use this in any way other than practice.**

This is a project series I am calling "Above the Fold" where I am going to be recreating a website _above the fold_. I am not going to do the functionality. This will purely HTML and CSS. The links won't go anywhere and the images / videos won't be real.

PLEASE NOTE: I did not make this responsive. My main goal for this project was to recreate the desktop version, above the fold.
